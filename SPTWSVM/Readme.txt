Description of files in SPTWSVM codes.

-----------------Scripts------------------
1. main.m : Used to calculate sparsity of SPTWSVM or TWSVM or Sparse Pin SVM models for linear case.

2. main_kernel.m : Used to calculate sparsity of SPTWSVM or TWSVM or Sparse Pin SVM models for non-linear case.

3. main_with_optimal_c.m : Used to calculate accuracy of SPTWSVM or TWSVM or Sparse Pin SVM models for linear case.

4. main_with_optimal_c_kernel.m : Used to calculate accuracy of SPTWSVM or TWSVM or Sparse Pin SVM models for non-linear case.
